# Global-Superstore-Dashboard


Overview 
With a huge product catalog that includes over 10,000 items, Global Superstore, an international online retailer, hopes to serve as a one-stop shop for its clients. The organization serves customers in 147 countries and works in multiple global markets. This project aimed to examine Global Superstore's 2014 sales data to spot patterns, opportunities, and difficulties.
Tool
•	Power BI
Data Cleaning 
The source dataset, which came from Digitaley Drive, included sales statistics. Initially, Power Query Editor was used to sanitize the data. Among them are: 
• Managing Missing Values: To guarantee completeness, missing values were found and rectified. The process involves swapping out null values.
• Computing Sales: Utilising New Measure to determine the overall profit as well as the average profit, shipping cost, and discount 

Data Visualization
I made an interactive dashboard with PowerBI to show the answers to the following queries:
Question 1. a) What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?  b) For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?
•	According to my research, China, India, and the United States were the top three nations in 2014 for Global Superstore's overall earnings. Additionally, the best-selling items in each nation were determined and displayed using a Bar, Line, and Area chart.
Question 2.  Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.
•	To show the top three subcategories in the Office Supplies category with the highest average shipping cost in the US, I created a bar chart for this question.
Question 3. a) Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries? b) What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.
•	When compared to other African nations, Nigeria's overall profit was very low, maybe as a result of high shipping expenses and small average discounts. To provide viewers with a good idea of the area, a Map was used to illustrate this.

Question 4. a) Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia. Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. b) Is there a specific country in Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the subcategory identified in 4a?
•	Office supplies was the least profitable segment in Southeast Asia; in nations with limited demand, it can be discontinued.

Question 5. a) Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders. b) Why is this city’s average profit so low?
• The worst-performing city in the US is Lancaster. The comparatively high average shipping cost of £23.99 and hefty operating expenditures may be connected to this.

Question 6. a) Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?
•	In Australia, appliances are the product subcategory with the greatest average profit.

Question 7. a) Who are the most valuable customers and what do they purchase?
•	Customers who often buy high-end items like Phones and copiers are the ones I consider to be the most valuable. I used the TreeMap to show these consumers, who are primarily located in China and the United States and have high average order values.

In conclusion 
In order to find patterns, opportunities, and difficulties, this Power BI project examined Global Superstore's 2014 sales data. The outcomes showed which nations, goods, and subcategories were doing the best. Furthermore, I noted areas that required development, like Nigeria's subpar performance and the requirement for shipping cost and discount optimisation. Global Superstore may boost customer happiness and operational efficiency by employing data-driven insights to make well-informed decisions.


Recommendations
To improve performance, Global Superstore should:
•	Increase marketing efforts in Nigeria
•	Review and optimize shipping costs
•	Discontinue underperforming subcategories in Southeast Asia
•	Analyse local market trends and adjust product portfolios accordingly
•	Focus on high-value customers who frequently purchase high-end products

By implementing these recommendations, Global Superstore can enhance its profitability and competitiveness in the global market.
